**4. I want to be able to consult orders in details, so I know which orders still need to be done and I can mark them as ready to avoid mixing them up.**

### Fixed Bugs
**1. "Create Order" issues**
- While creating the program and testing it a bug was found in the order creation option.
If you don't enter any quantities, a order is still created.
