### Test cases (user story based with screenshots)

**1. As a User, I want to have a smart, inexpensive and efficient solution to manage orders in my dry cleaning business.**

**2. I want to be able to enter new orders, as clients come into the store with items dropped off for dry cleaning.**

**3. I want to be able to enter how many and the type of items that are being dropped off.**

**4. I want to be able to consult orders in details, so I know which orders still need to be done and I can mark them as ready to avoid mixing them up.**

**5. I want to identify the orders with unique numbers, so I can quickly find my client's clothes when they are picking up at the store.**

**6. I want to mark orders as "picked up" when the customer gets their order.**

### Fixed Bugs
**1. "Create Order" issues**
- While creating the program and testing it a bug was found in the order creation option.
If you don't enter any quantities, a order is still created.
